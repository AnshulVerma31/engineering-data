## Who am I?
  

I am a **Data Engineer and an Architect** who has been working in mutiple sectors and industries to enable data-powered decision making. I love to work with open source tools and learn via code from others. 

I am a technologist with expertise in Data Engineering, Architecture and Governance. I have been working for over a decade now, and have served companies in several sectors (Telecom, Manufacturing, E-Commerce, and Insurance). I work with _Mckinsey & Company_, and I help my clients on their Digital and Analytics transformations. I specializes in building data-powered systems and advanced analytics platforms, and my core expertise lies in Data Engineering, Big data architecture design, Machine learning engineering and Business intelligence. 

When I gets away from my computer, I love anything outdoors; I am a **sportsperson by heart**.

## What do I do ?

I solve complex data Engineering challenges; some of them are :â€¨

* Process and store data (GBs to PBs) consistently and efficiently across a distributed cluster of dozens (or hundreds) of servers in an enterprise.
* Ingest complex, multi-structured data from a variety of real-world sources that dynamically evolve.
* Govern and make petabytes of data discoverable and usable.
* Evaluate the technical trade-offs of tools to build simple, yet robust, architectures that survive hardware failures. 
* Build systems to process (near)real-time data to automate decisions within seconds of incoming events/triggers.
* Enable and work alongside our Data Scientists to productionize advanced analytics algorithms to ensure business value
* Create visibility across the enterprise by building business intelligence reports and data warehouses
